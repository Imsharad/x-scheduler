# X-Scheduler: Twitter Automation Pipeline

## Project Goal
Create a complete Python-based Twitter (X) automation pipeline designed for organic, low-cost, continuous operation focused on maximizing reach and generating leads. This is an MVP project following the "move fast and break things" philosophy while strictly adhering to X API's Terms of Service, usage policies, and rate limits.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Cost Optimization**: Utilize free or low-cost services and libraries
2. **Reach Maximization**: Focus on consistent posting of valuable content
3. **Lead Generation**: Drive traffic to target destinations through CTAs
4. **Automation**: Run autonomously based on schedule with minimal intervention
5. **MVP Focus**: Implement essential features first then iterate

## Key Components
- Content sourcing from RSS feeds and curated content files
- Content processing with templating, hashtags, and CTAs
- Scheduled posting to Twitter/X with proper rate limit handling
- Basic tracking via UTM parameters
