# Important Considerations

## API Rate Limits
- **Critical**: Always respect Twitter/X API rate limits
- The Twitter v2 API has different rate limits for different endpoints
- The standard tweet posting limit is typically 300 requests per 3-hour window for standard API access
- The `TwitterPoster` class in [src/twitter_poster.py](mdc:src/twitter_poster.py) implements rate limit handling
- Always include delay between API calls and proper error handling for rate limit errors

## Content Guidelines
- Ensure all posted content complies with Twitter/X's terms of service
- Avoid duplicate or repetitive content which could be flagged as spam
- Maintain content variety and quality to maximize engagement
- Review all automated tweet templates to ensure they create readable, valuable tweets

## Security
- Never commit sensitive API keys to version control
- Always use the `.env` file for credentials and add it to `.gitignore`
- Restrict file permissions on the `.env` file on production servers

## Logging and Monitoring
- The logging system in [src/utils.py](mdc:src/utils.py) captures key pipeline events
- Monitor the logs regularly to catch any API errors or content issues
- Consider setting up alerts for critical failures
- Check the `processed_log.txt` file to track which content has been posted

## Lead Generation and Tracking
- All URLs should include UTM parameters for tracking in analytics
- Review analytics regularly to assess which content types perform best
- Adjust tweet templates, CTAs, and posting schedules based on performance data
