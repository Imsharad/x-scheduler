# Twitter/X Automation Pipeline - Project Summary

## Project Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL & ENHANCED WITH GOOGLE SHEETS INTEGRATION

The Twitter/X automation pipeline has been successfully implemented, simplified as requested, containerized using Docker for improved reliability and portability, and now enhanced with Google Sheets integration for easier content management. The project is fully operational with a minimal, maintainable codebase.

## Core Functionality

1. **Content Sources:** 
   - Simple CSV file with tweet content and post status
   - Google Sheets integration for remote content management
2. **Content Processing:** Direct tweet posting
3. **Twitter Integration:** API authentication and posting with rate limiting
4. **Scheduling:** Configurable intervals and specific posting times
5. **Automation:** Container-based deployment with automatic restarts
6. **Deployment:** Docker containerization for consistent, portable operation

## Key Components

| Component | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Project Structure | ✅ | Flat, minimal structure with essential files only |
| Configuration | ✅ | Environment variables for API credentials, YAML for application settings |
| Content Sources | ✅ | Simple CSV file with two columns (tweet, is_posted) and Google Sheets integration |
| Content Processing | ✅ | Direct use of tweet content without additional formatting |
| Twitter Integration | ✅ | Proper API handling, authentication, and rate limiting |
| Scheduling | ✅ | Interval and time-based scheduling |
| Helper Scripts | ✅ | Streamlined run.sh for local usage |
| Documentation | ✅ | Comprehensive README with usage instructions |
| Docker Containerization | ✅ | Application packaged into a container for reliable deployment |
| Google Sheets Integration | ✅ | Pull content from Google Sheets for easier remote management |

## Deployment Options

The project now supports two deployment methods:

### 1. Docker Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and start container
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### 2. Traditional Deployment 
```bash
# Initial setup (only needed once)
./run.sh --setup

# Run continuous scheduler
./run.sh --schedule

# Enable debug mode
./run.sh --schedule --debug
```

## Content Management Options

The project now supports two content management approaches:

### 1. Local CSV File (Original)
- Edit the CSV file directly in the project directory
- Simple for local development and testing

### 2. Google Sheets Integration (New)
- Manage content through a Google Sheet from anywhere
- No need to update files on the server
- Collaborative editing with multiple team members
- Spreadsheet-based workflow for content planning and scheduling

## Testing Results

A live test was performed with successful tweet posting from the containerized application. The deployed container reports successful verification of Twitter API credentials and has posted tweets successfully.

## Next Steps (Potential Future Enhancements)

1. **Analytics Integration:** Add basic analytics tracking for tweet performance
2. **User Interaction:** Implement functionality to respond to mentions or messages
3. **Web Interface:** Create a simple web dashboard for monitoring and control
4. **Enhancing Container Security:** Add non-root user, service health checks, and secrets management
5. **Additional Content Sources:** Support for more content sources like RSS feeds or database integration

---

This project successfully meets all the original requirements for a simple, efficient Twitter automation pipeline while maintaining strict adherence to the X/Twitter API's Terms of Service, usage policies, and rate limits. The containerized deployment provides improved reliability, maintainability, and consistency across environments. The Google Sheets integration adds significant convenience for remote content management without requiring direct server access. 

# X-Scheduler Project Summary

## Overview
X-Scheduler is a Python application designed to automate the scheduling and posting of content to Twitter/X. It supports text posts, images, and video content, with robust scheduling capabilities and content management through Google Sheets integration.

## Key Features
- Automated scheduling of tweets based on configurable time slots
- Support for text, image, and video content
- Google Sheets integration for easy content management
- OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure API access with full media upload capabilities
- Docker support for simplified deployment
- AWS infrastructure integration (S3, DynamoDB, EC2)
- Flexible configuration through YAML files

## Architecture
The application follows a modular approach with the following components:

1. **Content Sources**: Retrieves content from configured sources (Google Sheets, local files)
2. **Content Processor**: Formats content with templates, hashtags, CTAs, and UTM parameters
3. **Scheduler**: Handles the timing and execution of scheduled posts
4. **Twitter Poster**: Manages API interaction with Twitter/X, including OAuth 2.0 and media uploads
5. **Config Loader**: Loads and validates configuration from files and environment variables
6. **OAuth Web Server**: Handles user authentication via OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE

## Technical Specifications

### Languages and Libraries
- Python 3.9+
- Key dependencies:
  - requests, requests-oauthlib: API interactions
  - Flask: OAuth web server component
  - gspread, google-auth: Google Sheets integration
  - schedule: Task scheduling
  - boto3: AWS service integration
  - pyyaml: Configuration parsing

### Data Flow
1. Content is retrieved from configured sources (Google Sheets, local files)
2. Content is processed according to templates and formatting rules
3. Scheduler determines when to post based on configured schedules
4. Twitter Poster authenticates with Twitter/X API using OAuth 2.0
5. Content is posted at the scheduled time, with media handled via appropriate API endpoints

### Social Media Integration
- **Platform**: Twitter/X
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE
- **Required Scopes**: tweet.read, tweet.write, users.read, offline.access, media.write
- **API Endpoints**: v2 endpoints (/2/tweets, /2/media/upload)
- **Media Support**: 
  - Images: Direct upload
  - Videos: Chunked upload via /2/media/upload with status polling

## Deployment Options
- Local Python environment
- Docker container
- AWS EC2 instance
- Combination of AWS services (EC2, S3, DynamoDB)

## Current Status
- ✅ Core functionality implemented
- ✅ Google Sheets integration working
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication successfully implemented
- ✅ Video upload functionality working with v2 API
- ✅ Docker support available
- ✅ AWS infrastructure integration (S3, DynamoDB, EC2)

## Recently Completed
- Video upload functionality with OAuth 2.0 and required media.write scope
- Migration from v1.1 to v2 API endpoints for media uploads
- Enhanced error handling for API interactions

## Roadmap
- Enhanced analytics and reporting
- Support for additional social media platforms
- UI for configuration and monitoring
