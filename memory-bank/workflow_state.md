## Rules

*Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation.*

**# --- Core Workflow Rules ---**

RULE_WF_PHASE_ANALYZE:
  **Constraint:** Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.

RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT:
  **Constraint:** Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.

RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT:
  **Constraint:** Goal is executing the `## Plan` exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.

RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE:
  **Constraint:** Goal is verifying implementation against `## Plan` and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01:
  **Trigger:** Explicit user command (`@analyze`, `@blueprint`, `@construct`, `@validate`).
  **Action:** Update `State.Phase` accordingly. Log phase change.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02:
  **Trigger:** AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01).
  **Action:** Log the reason. Update `State.Phase` (e.g., to `BLUEPRINT_REVISE`). Set `State.Status` appropriately (e.g., `NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`). Report to user.

RULE_ITERATE_01: # Triggered by RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01 when State.Status == READY and State.CurrentItem == null, or after VALIDATE phase completion.
  **Trigger:** `State.Status == READY` and `State.CurrentItem == null` OR after `VALIDATE` phase completion.
  **Action:**
    1. Check `## Items` section for more items.
    2. If more items:
    3. Set `State.CurrentItem` to the next item.
    4. Clear `## Log`.
    5. Set `State.Phase = ANALYZE`, `State.Status = READY`.
    6. Log "Starting processing item [State.CurrentItem]".
    7. If no more items:
    8. Trigger `RULE_ITERATE_02`.

RULE_ITERATE_02:
  **Trigger:** `RULE_ITERATE_01` determines no more items.
  **Action:**
    1. Set `State.Status = COMPLETED_ITERATION`.
    2. Log "Tokenization iteration completed."

**# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---**

RULE_INIT_01:
  **Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` is missing or empty.
  **Action:**
    1. Create `workflow_state.md` with default structure.
    2. Read `project_config.md` (prompt user if missing).
    3. Set `State.Phase = ANALYZE`, `State.Status = READY`.
    4. Log "Initialized new session."
    5. Prompt user for the first task.

RULE_INIT_02:
  **Trigger:** AI session/task starts AND `workflow_state.md` exists.
  **Action:**
    1. Read `project_config.md`.
    2. Read existing `workflow_state.md`.
    3. Log "Resumed session."
    4. Check `State.Status`: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).

RULE_INIT_03:
  **Trigger:** User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state).
  **Action:** Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.

**# --- Memory Management Rules ---**

RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01:
  **Trigger:** Start of a new major task or phase.
  **Action:** Read `project_config.md`. Log action.

  **Trigger:** Before *every* decision/action cycle.
  **Action:**
    1. Read `workflow_state.md`.
    2. If `State.Status == READY` and `State.CurrentItem == null`:

    4. Trigger `RULE_ITERATE_01`.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01:
  **Trigger:** After *every* significant action or information receipt.
  **Action:** Immediately update relevant sections (`## State`, `## Plan`, `## Log`) in `workflow_state.md` and save.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01:
  **Trigger:** User command (`@config/update`) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change.
  **Action:** Propose concise updates to `project_config.md` based on `## Log`/diffs. Set `State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL`. Await user confirmation.

RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01:
  **Trigger:** After updating `workflow_state.md` or `project_config.md`.
  **Action:** Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set `State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`.

**# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---**

RULE_TOOL_LINT_01:
  **Trigger:** Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase.
  **Action:** Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT` if errors.

RULE_PROCESS_ITEM_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Phase == CONSTRUCT` and `State.CurrentItem` is not null and current step in `## Plan` requires item processing.
  **Action:**
    1. **Get Item Text:** Based on `State.CurrentItem`, extract the corresponding 'Text to Tokenize' from the `## Items` section.
    2. **Summarize (Placeholder):**  Use a placeholder to generate a summary of the extracted text.  For example, "Summary of [text] is [placeholder summary]".
    3. **Estimate Token Count:**
       a. Read `Characters Per Token (Estimate)` from `project_config.md`.
       b. Get the text content of the item from the `## Items` section. (Placeholder: Implement logic to extract text based on `State.CurrentItem` from the `## Items` table.)
       c. Calculate `estimated_tokens = length(text_content) / 4`.
    4. **Summarize (Placeholder):** Use a placeholder to generate a summary of the extracted text.  For example, "Summary of [text] is [placeholder summary]". (Placeholder: Replace with actual summarization tool/logic)
    5. **Store Results:** Append a new row to the `## TokenizationResults` table with:
       *   `Item ID`: `State.CurrentItem`
       *   `Summary`: The generated summary. (Placeholder: Implement logic to store the summary.)
       *   `Token Count`: `estimated_tokens`.
    6. Log the processing actions, results, and estimated token count to the `## Log`. (Placeholder: Implement logging.)

  **Action:** Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.

**# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---**

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_LINT`.
  **Action:** Analyze error in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED`, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01:
  **Trigger:** `State.Status` is `BLOCKED_TEST`.
  **Action:** Analyze failure in `## Log`. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset `State.Status`. If fail/complex, set `State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE`, `State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL`, propose revised `## Plan` based on failure analysis, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01:
  **Trigger:** Unexpected error or ambiguity.
  **Action:** Log error/situation to `## Log`. Set `State.Status = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN`. Report to user, request instructions.
